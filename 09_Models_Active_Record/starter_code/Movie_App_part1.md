#Movie App

Our client RetFlix wants BEWD students to develop an app.

They want an application that allows visitors to:

*	View all movies in the database.
*	Add a new movie to the database.
*	Edit a movie in the database.
*	And search for a specific movie.

We will build a Rails app for RetFlix during lesson 9 & 10. Each lesson we will add more functionality to the app.

Pairing is sharing, and happy coding :)

##Quick Setup

####Task Instructions

*	Create a new application called Movie_App.

*	Generate a Movies controller with an index action.

*	Set your root route to the index page.

*	Index.html.erb, welcomes users to the movie app. ("Welcome to RetFlix! See our collection of movies below").



##Movie Model

####Task Instructions

Add to your Movie_app

*	Pair Program.

*   Use the cheat sheet in the nodes.md as a reference!


*	Generate a Movie model with title, description and year_released attributes. (What types should each of thsee be?)

*	Use the movie_seeds.rb file to populate your database with movies. (Remember to copy the data to db/seeds.rb).

*	Update your movie's index.html.erb so that it lists all movies in the database, like we did for the shirts.

	*	Rails console is also your friend. Use it to explore active record methods that will help you interact with the database.

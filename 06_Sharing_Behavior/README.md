###Homework
Homework from last Thursday due next class.


Install Rails. 

Check if rails is already installed. Go to your terminal:

```
$ rails -v
```

If it's not installed you get:

```
Rails is not currently installed on this system. To get the latest version, simply type:

    $ sudo gem install rails

You can then rerun your "rails" command.
```

To install rails do this:

```
gem install rails --version 4.0.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc

```

After the command, take a quick look at the log, see if it looks like there were errors or if everything went ok.

Check again if rails is installed:

```
$ rails -v
Rails 4.0.0
```

####If you run into issues:
...don't worry we will help you during class. DO NOT run anything else by yourself (it may cause strange unexpected issues that will be difficult for the instructional team to diagnose).

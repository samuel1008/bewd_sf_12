#Code Demo

#Read this file and figure out what properties and methods the Apartment class needs to have!

#This part is important, it's how this file has access to the definition of the Apartment class:
require_relative 'lib/apartment'

#create a new Apartment 
# unit = "1A", sqft = 600, num_bedrooms = 1, num_bathrooms = 1
a1 = Apartment.new("1A", 600, 1, 1)

#Create a class that represents a contact (like for the address book)
#Contacts should store: name, number, email (use initialize method, remember it can take arguments)
#Write a method to_s (that will "override" the default to_s method) 
# => that prints contacts like so: "Name: Katya. Tele: 737-009-2711. Email: katya@example.com"
